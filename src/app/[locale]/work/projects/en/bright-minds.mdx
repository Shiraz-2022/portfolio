## Overview

In this project, I developed an application aimed at identifying dyslexia in children and offering personalized learning paths. The app used gamification to engage children, integrating rewards, interactive games, and fun elements to keep learning enjoyable. The goal was to provide a user-friendly experience for both children and parents, ensuring that the learning process remains fun while being educational.

## Key Features

- **Dyslexia Identification**: Developed a system that uses assessments to identify signs of dyslexia in children and creates customized learning paths based on the results.
- **Gamified Learning**: Designed a series of fun, interactive games that reward children as they progress through their personalized learning modules.
- **Adaptive Learning Paths**: The app adjusts learning paths according to individual progress, ensuring each child gets a tailored experience based on their needs.
- **Research-backed Modules**: All tests and learning modules were designed after extensive research, ensuring that the strategies used were evidence-based and effective.
- **Recognition**: Awarded recognition during MakeATon 2024 for its innovative approach to accessibility in education.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the front-end and creating an interactive user experience.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: For managing back-end processes and handling user data securely.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data and game progress.
- **AI-driven Analytics**: For assessing the results of dyslexia tests and adapting learning paths accordingly.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was ensuring that the gamification elements were both educational and engaging. It was important to balance fun with learning, keeping children motivated without sacrificing educational value. Additionally, implementing the dyslexia identification algorithm required careful consideration to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Outcome

The app has been successful in engaging children with dyslexia through its gamified approach, fostering a motivating learning environment. It won the Adapt Track at MakeATon 2024, South Indiaâ€™s largest hackathon, held at CUSAT Kochi. The project was recognized for its innovative use of AI and gamification to enhance accessibility in education. This achievement reflects the app's potential in transforming dyslexia education with its interactive and tailored learning experiences.
