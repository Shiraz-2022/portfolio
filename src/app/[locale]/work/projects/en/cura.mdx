## Overview

In this project, I created an app designed to empower chronic disease patients by providing them with essential health tools and a supportive community. The app offers real-time health tracking, AI-based meal analysis, personalized plans, and tools for managing fatigue, all while fostering a sense of community through local and global groups.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Health Tracking**: Integrated tracking for various health metrics, allowing patients to monitor their condition closely.
- **AI Meal Analysis**: Developed an AI-based feature that analyzes meal choices and provides personalized recommendations to improve health.
- **Fatigue Prediction**: Utilized smartwatch data to predict fatigue levels, helping patients manage their energy effectively.
- **Supportive Community**: Enabled patients to join both global and local support groups, share experiences, and get guidance from medical professionals.
- **Personalized Plans**: Created personalized health plans for patients, including meal recommendations, fitness routines, and medication reminders.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the cross-platform mobile app that works on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: For managing user data and backend services.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user profiles, health metrics, and meal data.
- **AI-based Algorithms**: For meal analysis, fatigue prediction, and personalized health plans.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was ensuring the appâ€™s data security and privacy, as it handles sensitive health information. We took extra care to implement strong encryption and secure data management practices. Additionally, integrating real-time data tracking and providing meaningful insights from it required continuous collaboration with healthcare professionals.

## Outcome

The project has garnered significant recognition. It was selected as one of the top 50 projects out of more than 800 submissions at the PECx Hackathon in Chennai. This recognition reflects the potential of the app in transforming chronic disease management, and its innovative features like AI-driven health insights and community support have been praised for their impact on patient care. The project is still evolving, with plans for future implementation.
