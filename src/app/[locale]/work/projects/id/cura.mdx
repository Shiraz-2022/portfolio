## Overview

In this project, I created an app designed to empower chronic disease patients by providing them with essential health tools and a supportive community. The app offers real-time health tracking, AI-based meal analysis, personalized plans, and tools for managing fatigue, all while fostering a sense of community through local and global groups.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Health Tracking**: Integrated tracking for various health metrics, allowing patients to monitor their condition closely.
- **AI Meal Analysis**: Developed an AI-based feature that analyzes meal choices and provides personalized recommendations to improve health.
- **Fatigue Prediction**: Utilized smartwatch data to predict fatigue levels, helping patients manage their energy effectively.
- **Supportive Community**: Enabled patients to join both global and local support groups, share experiences, and get guidance from medical professionals.
- **Personalized Plans**: Created personalized health plans for patients, including meal recommendations, fitness routines, and medication reminders.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the cross-platform mobile app that works on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: For managing user data and backend services.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user profiles, health metrics, and meal data.
- **AI-based Algorithms**: For meal analysis, fatigue prediction, and personalized health plans.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was ensuring the appâ€™s data security and privacy, as it handles sensitive health information. We took extra care to implement strong encryption and secure data management practices. Additionally, integrating real-time data tracking and providing meaningful insights from it required continuous collaboration with healthcare professionals.

## Outcome

The app has been successful in helping chronic disease patients manage their health more effectively. By combining health tracking with AI-driven insights and a supportive community, Cura has been praised for its holistic approach to patient care. Patients have reported feeling more empowered and connected with others going through similar experiences.
